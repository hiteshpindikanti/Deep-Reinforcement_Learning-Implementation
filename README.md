Learning Atari Pong using Q-Learning with Reinforcement Learning: saving all the data.

This program is made with reference to Dhruv Parthasarathy's blog: https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0

Also added the option to save the data, so that one doesn't have to run the whole program at one stretch. As the blog says that training may take upto a few days. Moreover, to completely train the A.I. to win against traditional agent, it needs about 2,000,000 games (20 lakhs or 2 million).

The game number, game score and the running mean are being stored at every iteration. Hence, one can perform statistical operations on the generated data.
